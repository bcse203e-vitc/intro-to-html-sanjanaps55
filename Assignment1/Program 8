    <h1>Paragraph 1</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nbsp is actually one of the most frequently used HTML entities. Nbsp stands for non-breaking space, meaning 
        that strings separated with this entity will not be separated and put into separate lines.</p>
    <h1>Paragraph 2</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old HTML editor, this can be more tricky. You can try inserting &nbsp; right into the editor. However, if your theme doesn’t have 
        CSS rules specifying how it should be rendered (and many don’t), you’ll probably see a raw code displayed on the page.</p>
